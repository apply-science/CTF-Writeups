# *My picoGYM training challenges writeups.*
Please register at picoCTF.org and give the challenge a serious try before going for a writeup. It's not about getting the points, it is about becoming better.

My recommendation is to create a folder for each category/challenge for clarity. I will assume that you are at a linux machine with a web browser and terminal. Any other tools will be specified in the writeup. 

## *Depencencies*
Following dependecies have been installed in order to solve the challenges:
> apt install hxtools

> pip install pwntools
